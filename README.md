Password Strength Analyzer Project

This project involves building a web-based Password Strength Analyzer tool to evaluate the robustness of user passwords based on key security criteria. The tool uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

Features:
Password Evaluation: Analyzes passwords for:
Length (minimum 8 characters)
Inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters
Numbers
Special characters
Avoidance of common passwords

Real-Time Feedback: Provides users with:
A strength rating (Weak, Moderate, or Strong)

Actionable advice for improving password security.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean, responsive design ensures ease of use.

Implementation:
HTML: Creates the input field, button, and placeholders for results.
CSS: Styles the interface for readability and aesthetics.
JavaScript: Implements logic for password analysis and dynamically updates results.

The project is organized in a modular structure with three separate files (index.html, styles.css, and script.js), ensuring scalability and maintainability.

Outcome:
The Password Strength Analyzer enhances user awareness of password security practices, promoting better cybersecurity habits.
